COVID-19 Data Analytics Project
Overview
This project analyzes COVID-19 case and vaccination data in India to deliver meaningful insights on the pandemicâ€™s development at the state level. It processes datasets containing confirmed cases, recoveries, deaths, and vaccinations to calculate key metrics such as active cases, recovery rates, and mortality rates. The results are visualized through graphs and summarized in pivot tables to facilitate understanding of regional trends and impacts.

Features
Data cleaning and preprocessing

Calculation of active cases per state

Correction of state name inconsistencies

Generation of statewise summaries with recovery and mortality rates

Data visualization using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly

Interactive COVID-19 vaccine data analysis

Data Sources
COVID-19 India case data (covid_19_india.csv)

COVID-19 India vaccine data (covid_vaccine_statewise.csv)
